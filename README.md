This is a project made to explain the apparent cyclical motion of an array of pendula as seen in the video below.

An interesting part of modeling this came in the form of a small angle approximation.  Here you can see the difference in complexity of using the full restoring force (dependent on amplitude) vs. the non-amplitude dependent approximation.

The difference in results can be seen in the notebook file linked above.
